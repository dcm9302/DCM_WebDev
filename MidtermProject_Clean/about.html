      <p>
        Hi! I'm Daniela Marin, a student at NYU majoring in Integrated Design
        and Media with a minor in Psychology. Creativity has always been at the
        core of who I am--whether through drawing, crocheting, baking, or
        photography. I never knew how to channel my passion for visual
        storytelling into a career until I started exploring marketing strategy,
        advertising, UX/UI Design, and graphic design.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to create meaningful experiences and visuals that connect
        people with brands and ideas. I'm passionate about designing intuitive
        user experiences, creating impactful marketing strategies, and building
        user-friendly apps and visuals that drive meaningful initiatives. I'm
        constantly learning and evolving, and this website serves as a glimpse
        into my journey as a designer.
