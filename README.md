Documentation of Final:

Explanation of some code: I used custom JS array and loop to scatter my graphic designs across the page dynamically. I animated the scattered images with GSAP Scroll Trigger as the user scrolls. I wrote my own CSS and JS layout logic.  I used a forEach loop to create image elements on the page and Math.random to assign each image a random position and rotation giving a scattered effect. I used GSAP scroll trigger plugin with a fromTo function that sets each images scale. 
Challenges: Figuring out how to position and overlap multiple images randomly/ Images were not displaying initially due to opacity and class conflicts (.gs-reveal)
Something cool I did: Implementation: Uses a JS function that randomly selects an image and title from an array and displays is dynamically on button click. I used GSAP to animate the fade-in and upward motion of each image reveal.
Improvement: I wrote the logic to shuffle the array and avoid repetition 
Implementation: I used Bootstrapâ€™s responsive grid system to ensure consistent card sizing across all breakpoints. I added custom card hover effects with CSS including colored glows and font pairing improvements. Google fonts for title and description font changes were implemented. 
Improvement: My earlier version used unevenly sized cards and minimal styling without any effects. I improved columns added hover interactions. 

What I learned:
Implement GSAP animations to enhance interactivity
How to randomize image layout using arrays and custom logic
How to integrate BS grid system while still customizing it 
Next steps: 
Add to UX section and make interactive with video and prototype embeds
Add loading animations for better transitions
Expand cake section into interactive gallery with more hover effects
